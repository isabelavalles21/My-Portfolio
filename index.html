                <h2>Welcome to Isabela's Portfolio</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Isabela, a student studying Technology Management BIT at Ontario Tech University. Here you can find information about some of my projects I've done for school. I enjoy all things business and tech. I've competed in various case competitions and hackathons, where I've had the opportunity to apply my skills in real-world scenarios. I love to network with new people and learn from their experiences. I am also Vice President of IT for the Business and IT Society here at Ontario Tech University. Outside of school, I own a small business called "Beliciousweets". You can find it on instagram @beliciousweets and there you will see all of the cakes and sweet treats I've made. Also, I volunteer my free time at my local church and help out as a Youth Leader and sing on the Worship Team.</p>
